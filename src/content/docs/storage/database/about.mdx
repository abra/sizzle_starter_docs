Apps managing substantial structured data can significantly improve
performance and user experience by storing this data locally. A key scenario is
caching essential data, enabling users to access content offline when network
connectivity is unavailable.

Drift offers a sophisticated abstraction over SQLite, facilitating smooth
database operations and leveraging SQLite's capabilities. Key advantages of
using Drift include:

- Dart APIs for defining tables, complex queries, and transactions.
- User-friendly code generation that reduces the need for repetitive,
  error-prone code.
- Efficient and simplified paths for database migration.

## Primary Components

There are 3 primary components in Drift:

- **Database**: The `@DriftDatabase` class manages the database, serving as the
  primary gateway for your app to access its persistent data.
- **Companions**: Classes that Drift generate for each table. They are used to
  insert and update data in your database.
- **Data access objects** (DAOs): classes that provide methods your app can use
  to query, update, insert, and delete data in the database.

The database class specifies the Tables used, so Drift can understand what
tables this class is interested in. It gives full access to table(s) and
generates code to query, insert, update, or delete data.

## Sample Implementation

This section presents a sample implementation of a Drift database with a
single table and a single DAO.

### Table

The provided code defines a `Todos` table.
Drift supports both Dart and SQL syntax for table definition.
While both options are supported, **SQL** is generally considered the preferred choice due to its language independence, type safety, and enhanced capabilities for handling complex queries.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="SQL">

```sql
CREATE TABLE todos (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  category INTEGER
);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Dart">

```dart
/// Todos table definition
final class TodosTable extends Table {
  /// The identifier for this todo.
  IntColumn get id => integer().autoIncrement()();

  /// The title of this todo.
  TextColumn get title => text().withLength(min: 6, max: 32)();

  /// The content of this todo.
  TextColumn get content => text().named('body')();

  /// Category of this todo.
  IntColumn get category => integer().nullable()();
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Data Access Object (DAO)

The following code defines a `TodosDao`. `TodosDao` provides methods that
perform database operations, such as `getTodosInCategory` and `getTodoById`.
This Dao is later used by the repository to get data from the database.

```dart
class TodosDao {
  TodosDao(AppDatabase db) : super(db);

  /// Returns all todos in the given [category].
  Future<List<Todo>> getTodosInCategory(int category) {
    return (select(todos)..where((t) => t.category.equals(category))).get();
  }

  /// Inserts the given [todo] into the database.
  Future insert(TodosCompanion todo) => into(todos).insert(todo);
}
```

To learn more, about DAOs, see [Data Access Objects](/storage/database/accessing-data).

### Database

The following code defines an `AppDatabase` class. `AppDatabase` specifies
the tables and DAOs that you want to include in the database.
To satisfy the Drift requirements, you must:

- Annotate your database class with `@DriftDatabase` and specify the tables
  and DAOs that you want to include in the database.

- Extend your database class from `_$NameOfDatabase` and implement the
  `schemaVersion` getter.
- Implement the `MigrationStrategy` getter to define the migration strategy
  for the database in case of schema changes.

This class may also be used to define **database migrations**. See the
[Migrations](/storage/database/migrations) section for more information.

```dart
@DriftDatabase(tables: [TodosTable])
class AppDatabase extends _$AppDatabase {
  /// {@macro app_database}
  AppDatabase() : super(createExecutor());

  @override
  int get schemaVersion => 1;
}
```

### Usage

After you have defined your table, DAO, and database, you can use them in your
app. The following code shows how to use the `TodosDao` to insert a todo into
the database.

```dart
final db = AppDatabase();
final dao = TodosDao(db);
final todo = TodosCompanion.insert(
  title: 'Buy milk',
  content: 'Go to the store and buy milk',
  category: 0,
);

await dao.insert(todo);
final todos = await dao.getTodosInCategory(0);
print(todos); // [Todo(1, Buy milk, Go to the store and buy milk, 0)]
```
