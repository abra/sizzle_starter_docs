description: "Еhe optimal file and folder organization within the Sizzle Starter architecture."
---

Sizzle Starter uses a feature-based structure, which is a popular
approach for structuring large-scale applications. It's a modular
architecture that encapsulates related functionalities within
self-contained modules.

## General Folder Structure

Code in Sizzle Starter is organized into the following directories:

```text
root - Project directory
├── src - Root of all source code
│   ├── core - Core application code
│   │   ├── assets - Static and generated asset files
│   │   ├── localization - Language files and auto-generated translations
│   │   ├── components - Reusable components
│   │   │   ├── rest_client - REST client
│   │   │   └── database - Drift Database
│   │   └── utils - General purpose utility functions
│   └── feature - Modular feature containers
│       ├── auth - Authentication feature
│       ├── cart - Shopping cart feature
│       └── catalog - Product catalog feature
├── test - Directory for test code
├── pubspec.yaml - Project dependencies and metadata
└── main.dart - Application entry point
```

### Core Directory

The `core` directory is the heart of your application.
It houses utilities and configurations that provide functionality across multiple
features. Here are some examples:

- **Mixins and Extensions:** Commonly used functions or properties that can be
  mixed into classes.
- **Rest Client:** Standardized configurations and methods for API requests.
- **Database:** Database configurations and methods for data access.
- **Localization:** Language files and auto-generated translations.
- **BLoC Observer:** Debugging and monitoring tool for the BLoC pattern.
- **Theme:** Customizable theme data for the application.
- **Assets**: Static and generated asset files.

:::danger
Avoid impulsively moving files to the `core` directory, it can quickly become bloated.
It should be done with careful consideration and only when the code is truly
reusable across multiple features.
:::

### Feature Directory

The `feature` directory houses all of the features in your application.
Each feature is a self-contained module that encapsulates its own logic and
widgets. It's a modular architecture that allows you to easily add and
remove features.

Let's take a look at the `catalog` feature:

```text
catalog - Product catalog feature
├── bloc - Business logic components
│   ├── catalog_bloc.dart - Catalog BLoC
│   └── catalog_event.dart - Catalog BLoC events
├── model - Dtos and entities
├── data - Data layer
│   ├── repository - Repository
│   └── data_source - Data source
└── widget - Widgets layer
    ├── catalog_screen.dart - Catalog Screen
    ├── product_card.dart - Product Card
    └── product_details_screen.dart - Product Details Screen
```

:::tip
Dependencies between features should be minimized to avoid coupling.
